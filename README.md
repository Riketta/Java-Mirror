# Java Mirror
 Or may be better to call it **JavaBridge**.  
 JavaMirror logs arguments and all logs between caller and java.exe.  
 Useful for example to create custom Minecraft launcher (at least I use it in this way).  
### Usage
 Put java_mirror.exe into java folder near bin folder to allow it using "bin\java.exe" (of copy "bin" folder to java_mirror.exe).  
 After this use java_mirror.exe instead of java.exe in usual way - nothing changes.  
 For example: "D:\java_mirror\java_mirror.exe"; "D:\java_mirror\bin\java.exe".  
 In result log file will be saved near java_mirror.exe with name starts with java_mirror_*.txt
